### Details
I built an algorithm that sorts through your choices and compares them to a celebrities. I made up their personalities and do not take responsibility for mistaken personalities. Users are given 10 questions about their personalities. Each question has choices between 1-5. Once the questions are complete, the choices are then compared to a handful of fake celebrity personalities and the User is matched the celebrity with the least amount of differences.
